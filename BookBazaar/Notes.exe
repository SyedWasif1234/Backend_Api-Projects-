:( Error :
    in my book routes i passed /:id as params and in my controller i am accessing it as 
    const {book_id}= req.params but here book id is coming null 

    :)fixed:
        /:book_id in  router == const const {book_id}= req.params in controller

:) req.header i have to include in header : 

    ✅ 1. Using Postman

       -> Select the request method: GET
       -> URL: http://localhost:5000/some-protected-route (or your actual URL)
       -> Go to the Headers tab
       ->Add a new header:
       -> Key: x-api-key
       -> Value: your generated API key (e.g., abc123...)
